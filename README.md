# MVC project using Express 
this is an exercise on some tools that be used frequently with Express.js. And it's NOT  a complete project (will work on completing it asap), just an exercise.
I also structured my project as MVC Architecture so, keep your eyes on model, controller and views directories. 


### I used:
- pug -> template engine 
- passport-fb -> to enable login with facebook feature
- sequelize -> to deal with relational database smoothly 
- mongoose -> to deal with MongoDB
